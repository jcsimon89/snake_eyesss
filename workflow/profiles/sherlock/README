These are my notes on what's going on with this profile.

It's from here: https://github.com/Snakemake-Profiles/slurm

without profiles, one would submit a job using slurm like this:

> snakemake --cluster "sbatch --partition trc"

Here, we can define default values such as partition in the settings.json under SBATCH_DEFAULTS
for example like this:

> "SBATCH_DEFAULTS": "--partition=trc --mail-type=ALL",

(An alternative way would be to create a file with default settings as described here:
http://bluegenes.github.io/Using-Snakemake_Profiles/)
